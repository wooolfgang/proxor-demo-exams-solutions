readme.txt -- for parentheses

THE TASK

The spreadsheet implements simple formulas that begin with equal (=). A
formula can be either references to cells of the form
=<letter><digits>, such as =C8, or a sequence of cell references separated
by binary operators (+, -, *, or /), such as =C8+B2*A3. (Note that
operators are evaluated left-to-right without regard for operator
precedence; e.g., the previous example is evaluated as (C8 + B2) * A3.)

To complete this task, modify SpreadSheet.java to allow the use of
parentheses in formulas. For example, =C8+(B2*A3) should be a valid
formula, and it should be evaluated in the expected way.

Note: Parenthesis (singular) and parentheses (plural) are the common
American English terms for "(" and ")". They are also called round
brackets in the United Kingdom.
